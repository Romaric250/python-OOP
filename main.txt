Object Oriented Programming in Python

What is an object??
    An object is a datatype that can store data, but it also contains operations defined to act that data.
    It knows stuff and can do stuff


Generally, Objects represent:
        tangible entities: student, airline, car, etc
        intangible entities: data streams

    interactions between objects defines the system operations(through message passing)



An object has Attributes(a.k.a knows stuff) and Methods (a.k.a can do stuff)

lets take an example of an object called circle.
 It has Attributes like radius, center, color. 
 It also has methods like move and change color


All  objects are said to be an instance of some class. 
The class of an object determines which Attributes the object will have

A class is a description of what its instance will know and do.
